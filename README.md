## 🧠 About This Project

This is a **customized version** of the original [Material Dashboard 2 React](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard-react) template created by Creative Tim. I’ve modified it to use a **dark theme by default**, added personal customizations, and prepared it for real-world admin panel or dashboard use.

> Designed and modified by **Abdul Ahad**
